🎮 🕹️ Project Description 
 
This project is a simple Whack-a-Mole browser game.


The game shows a board with 9 holes arranged in a grid. 
 
A mole pops up in one hole at a time, and the player has to tap/click the mole to score points.



🔨 How the Game Works 

 
🕳️ A 3 × 3 grid creates 9 spaces  
🐹 A mole randomly appears in one hole  
🖱️ The player clicks the mole to hit it  
🏆 The score increases when the mole is hit  


💻 Languages Used  


📄 HTML – builds the game layout  
🎨 CSS – styles the board, holes, and mole  
⚙️ JavaScript – controls mole movement, clicks, and scoring
